> [!info] Making sense of the sign
> Here's a rule of thumb: Heat flow and work have a *negative sign* when transferred *from* a system, but have a *positive sign* when transferred *to* the system.
# Problem 1.1
A gas expands from 3L to 10L against an external pressure of 1.2 atm. What's the work done by the gas in, joules?

-

We want to calculate work, for which the equation is w=-PdV. We know the following:
- P = 1.2atm
- dV = Final volume - initial volume = 10L - 3L = 7L

Therefore w=(-1.2atm)(7L)=-8.4atm L
The question asks us to convert to Joules. The conversion factor for this is 101.3J = 1 Latm

Multiply and solve: -8.4 Latm (101.3J/1Latm) = -8.51 x 10^2 J

Fact check: Work is done *by* the systemâ€”think of the monsterâ€”so w should be negative

# Problem 1.2

A gas is compressed from 6L to 2L against an external pressure of 3.7 atm. What's the work done by the gas, in joules?

-

Again, using the equation w = -PdV, we know the following:
- P = 3.7 atm
- dV = 2L - 6L = -4L
> [!warning] warning
> dV is not always positive. Read the problem carefully to determine the *initial* and *final* volume. If you got dV=4L, you confused the final and initial volume.

Therefore, w=-(3.7atm)(-4L)(101.3J/1atmL)=1.5x10^3J

Fact check: Work is done *on* the system, so w should be positive.


# Problem 1.3

A certain gas in the cylinder of an engine is compressed from 2.2L to 0.6L against an external pressure of 8.0 atm. During the process, you have the nerve to touch the engine while its running, and 140 joules of energy in the form of heat is transferred from the engine into the "surroundings" (your hand). Ow! 

What's the total change in internal energy (dU) of the gas, in joules?

-

This time, we use the equation dU=q+w. we know that w = -PdV, so we can rewrite this equation as dU = q - PdV. let's solve for the values on the right hand side:
- q = -140J (remember, heat is transferred *from* the system to the surroundings, so q is negative. Think of the monster.)
- P = 8.0 atm
- dV = 0.6L - 2.2L = -1.6L (remember, don't mix up final and initial volume!)

Plug in and solve: dU = -140J - (8.0 atm)(-1.6 L)(101.3J/1atmL)=1.16x10^3J

> this should make sense. the engine is generating energy, so it makes sense that the energy of the engine is increasing.

# Problem 1.4
A gas is in a piston expands from 0.24L to 1.35L against an external pressure of 2.41 atm. During this expansion, 202J of heat is transferred from the surroundings to the gas. What is the internal energy change (dU) of this process, in joules?

We will again use dU = q+w, or equivalently dU = q - PdV.
- q=202J (*from* surroundings to system means q is positive)
- P=2.41 atm
- dV=1.35L-0.25L=1.11L

Plug in and solve: dU = 202J-(2.41atm)(1.11L)(101.3J/1atmL)=-69J, nice
