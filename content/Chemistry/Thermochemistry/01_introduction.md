title: Introduction
---
Thermochemistry, broadly speaking, is the study of **heat changes**. For example, you'll be investigating phenomena such as dropping a hot metal ball into some cold water and recording the final temperature and the change in heat.

It's important to define some terms for our workings later on.

> [!info] Terms
> - The **system** is what is of interest in the study.
> - The environment, or **surroundings**, is everything else, typically outside the system.

For instance, let's say we're investigating the heat of coffee inside your mug. The system would be the coffee, and the surroundings would be whatever was outside the coffee, like the air, or your cat.

There are three main types of systems:
1. **Open**: heat and matter can be exchanged between the system and surroundings.
	- Example: Your coffee mug, since heat can be transferred, as well as matter (like cat hair)
2. **Closed**: heat can be exchanged, but not matter. 
	- Example: A closed water bottle, since it can be heated up on a hot summer day.
3. **Isolated**: nothing can be exchanged.
	- Example: A thermoflask, which is designed to keep heat in.

With this, we'll move onto exothermic and endothermic processes.
