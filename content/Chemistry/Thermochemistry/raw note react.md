- Typical Reactions

$q_{sys}=q_{H_2O}+q_{cal}+q_{rxn}$

in a constant volume you calculate qcal
constant pressure = qh2o + qmetal + qcal

set qsolution := qh2o+qmetal
qsys = qsolution + qrxn
0 = qsolution + qrxn
$$q_{solution}=-q_{rxn}$$

when you see *negligible heat capabity of the calorimeter*, you set qcal to 0. if you see qcal, or the *heat capacity of the calorimeter* you add the qcal term.

$$q_{solution}=ms\Delta T=-q_{rxn}$$
depending on your question write in kJ (*heat change*) or kJ/mol (*molar heat of neutralization*)

bomb calorimeter has constant volume

assume aqueous solution so convert mL to g one to one (e.g. 100mL=100g). also assume that the heat capacity in water is 4.186 J/g\*C

$$q_{cal}=C\Delta T$$
C is the heat capacity of the bomb calorimeter

for constant volume calorimeter assume qh2o=0
for constant pressure calorimeter use qh20=msT

if the metal does not react, do not add it to the mass

$$q_{metal}=-q_{h2o}$$

when given the specific heat capacity of something other than water, for example ethanol, use that as qh2o instead of 









# standard enthalpy
if you've learned the enthalpy formula, it depends on a lot of variables that usually have to be measured experimentally. it's tedious to calculate the enthalpy by experimenting with the reaction every single time.

this is why chemists use the standard enthalpy of formation, which allows us to calculate the enthalpy of a reaction based on some basic building blocks for enthalpy.

it's like calculating the weight of a fruit bowl. you *could* put it on the scale to weigh it, but if you don't have a scale, you could note that an apple weighs 150g and a banana weighs 100g, and that there are 2 apples and 3 bananas, so you can calculate the weight by just adding the weights.

not stable form of element has standard enthalpie of formation be a nonzero value

hess's law

reversing the reaction reverses the sign of the enthalpy
