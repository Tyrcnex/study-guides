title: Thermodynamics

You might know that **exothermic** processes give off heat, while **endothermic** processes absorb heat. We can situate this more concretely with systems and energy:
- **Exothermic**: Energy is **transformed from** the system *to* the surroundings.
- **Endothermic**: Energy is **supplied to** the system *from* the surroundings

# First Law of Thermodynamics
Notice that, from above, energy is never lost, only transferred. This is the first law of thermodynamics. It is represented as the following equation: 

$$\Delta U=q+w$$
> [!info] Notation
> Remember, $\Delta$ represents a *change*.

This is a simple looking formula that holds a deep meaning. Let's look at it further:
- $\Delta U$ represents the change in **internal energy** (how much energy is "stored" in the system)
- $q$ represents heat transferred from or to the system. 
> [!faq]- What's the sign of q?
> Recall exothermic and endothermic reactions. If we're looking *at the system*, and heat is transferred out of the system, what do you think is the sign of $q$?
> > [!todo]- Answer
> > Since it's going *out* of the system, heat is lost from the system to the surroundings, so $q$ should be negative.
- $w$ represents **work**. In chemistry, it describes a change in the amount of energy when a volume acts against an external pressure (for example, a gas expanding against air pressure).

Work can be represented as $w=-P\Delta V$, where $P$ is pressure and $\Delta V$ is a change in volume.
> [!info]- Why do we need the negative sign?
> Let's think of a scenario where a gas is expanding against its surroundings.

> This is work done *by the system on its surroundings*, so this is *exothermic*. Since in an exothermic reaction we're transferring ("losing") energy to the surroundings, the change in energy should be negative. Since work is a measure of the change in energy, this means that work should be negative too, and so we need that negative sign.

That was complicated! Take a little time for that to sink in. If that still doesn't quite make sense. If it still doesn't quite make sense, maybe some sample problems might help.
