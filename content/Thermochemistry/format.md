>[!faq]- Problem 2
>A gas is compressed from 6L to 2L against an external pressure of 3.7 atm. What's the work done by the gas, in joules?

Again, using the equation w = -PdV, we know the following:
- P = 3.7 atm
- dV = 2L - 6L = -4L
/> > [!warning] warning
/> > dV is not always positive. Read the problem carefully to determine the *initial* and *final* volume. If you got dV=4L, you confused the final and initial volume.

Therefore, w=-(3.7atm)(-4L)(101.3J/1atmL)=1.5x10^3J

Fact check: Work is done *on* the system, so w should be positive.
