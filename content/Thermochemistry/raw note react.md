- Typical Reactions

$q_{sys}=q_{H_2O}+q_{cal}+q_{rxn}$

in a constant volume you calculate qcal
constant pressure = qh2o + qmetal + qcal

set qsolution := qh2o+qmetal
qsys = qsolution + qrxn
0 = qsolution + qrxn
$$q_{solution}=-q_{rxn}$$

when you see *negligible heat capabity of the calorimeter*, you set qcal to 0. if you see qcal, or the *heat capacity of the calorimeter* you add the qcal term.

$$q_{solution}=ms\Delta T=-q_{rxn}$$
depending on your question write in kJ (*heat change*) or kJ/mol (*molar heat of neutralization*)

bomb calorimeter has constant volume

assume aqueous solution so convert mL to g one to one (e.g. 100mL=100g). also assume that the heat capacity in water is 4.186 J/g\*C

$$q_{cal}=C\Delta T$$
C is the heat capacity of the bomb calorimeter

for constant volume calorimeter assume qh2o=0
for constant pressure calorimeter use qh20=msT

if the metal does not react, do not add it to the mass

$$q_{metal}=-q_{h2o}$$

when given the specific heat capacity of something other than water, for example ethanol, use that as qh2o instead of
