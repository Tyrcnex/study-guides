I'm sometimes a little frustrated with the education system. In many classes, the curriculum promotes memorization rather than conceptualization, which to me doesn't feel like learning at all. I don't like the idea of teaching students by merely reading from a textbook and doing problems. I like it when teachers explain what a concept means so that you really understand what's going on. I also believe that, when the teacher provides an answer to a problem, they should explain what that result means, and why it matters.

That's what I have tried to do in this collection of study guides. I've tried to provide simple analogies and more in-depth explanations that really encourage you to think a little deeper about what teachers teach you. I provide self-made problems and in-depth solutions so you can practice for a test while really understanding the context of the solutions. I also provide occasional warnings on parts I see that students stumble on a few times.

Instead of the traditional memorize-and-grind method of teaching that science and math teachers usually use, I try to reduce the amount of math that you need to memorize and more of the math that you understand. You'll find that in my calculus study guide (coming soon!) there won't be a lot of strange math symbols, but rather images and other media that is easier to digest.

These study guides mainly focus on chemistry and calculus.
- In each chemistry unit, you'll typically find ordered articles with lots of explanations and examples that you can work through, as well as a Problems page at the end to test your understanding and prepare for the test.
- (calculus guides coming soon!)

These study guides are still a work in progress. There's still problems to be made, and images/videos to be created. If you want to contribute, you can message me on Discord (username: **tyrcnex**) and send me a Google Docs or a PDF of your study guide, and I'll do my best to transcribe it here.
